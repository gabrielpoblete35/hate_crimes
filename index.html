    <h1>Hate crimes in NYC by police precinct

    <p>
      MIAMI -- NYPD numbers confirmed hate crime incidents are occurring more frequently in Lower Manhattan and nearby neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      652 confirmed incidents of hate crimes have been confirmed from January 2019 through September 2020, according to open data website. 208 of those incidents have occurred this year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NYC Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice had reported a 15% increase from 2018 to 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, the city council approved creating the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. Deborah Lauter, the executive director, said in a press release that the office is fully staffed and ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the need to pay attention to NYC’s Jewish communities, “because of the increase in hate crimes motivated by anti-Semitism, particularly targeting the religious Jewish communities in Brooklyn…”
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the goals of the office is to address the problem of underreporting such incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s the rate of incidents by precinct:
